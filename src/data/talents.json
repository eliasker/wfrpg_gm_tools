You can recall a sequence as long as your Intelligence without having to make a Test. For every 10 more items you attempt to memorise, you must make an increasingly difficult Intelligence Test to recall the list correctly, starting at Ver y Easy (+60) for +10, Easy (+40) for +20, Average (+20) for +30, and so on. Beyond it’s obvious utility for Gamble Tests, where having this Talent adds a bonus of +20 to +60 depending upon how useful recalling sequences is to the game at hand, the GM can apply bonuses to other Tests as appropriate. Each time you take this Talent you may recall an extra sequence without having to forget a previously stored one.",
